# React Hooks Flow
The goal of this app is to help people understand how [React Hooks work](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). You can add and nest multiple components and use your browser's developer console to see when and how triggers are, well..., triggered.

üëâ This application was based on [Donavon West](https://github.com/donavon)'s [React hooks flow](https://github.com/donavon/hook-flow) diagram.

If you don't feel like running this project locally, it's also hosted on Vercel (‚ù§Ô∏è) and you can check it [here](https://react-hooks-flow.vercel.app/).

### Instructions
For starting the project, you just need to run your tipical commands for a React project.
```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

Once you have it running, go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) and you'll see the instructions to use the app.

Enjoy and hopefully you'll find this app useful üôÇ
